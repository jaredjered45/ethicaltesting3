- [ ] Incident response plan in place

### ✅ Technical Configuration
- [ ] `config.php` properly configured with your SMTP settings
- [ ] Receiver email address is a monitored security mailbox
- [ ] Test environment setup and validated
- [ ] `test.php` shows all systems working correctly
- [ ] File permissions properly set (web server can write to log files)
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificate properly configured for HTTPS
- [ ] Debug mode disabled in production (`'debug_mode' => false`)

### ✅ Server Security
- [ ] Web server hardened and up to date
- [ ] PHP configuration secure (error reporting off in production)
- [ ] Access logs properly configured
- [ ] Outbound SMTP connections allowed on required ports
- [ ] Rate limiting configured at server level if needed
- [ ] Firewall rules properly configured

### ✅ Monitoring and Logging
- [ ] Log file rotation configured
- [ ] Monitor notification email mailbox regularly
- [ ] Server access logs being monitored
- [ ] Incident response procedures documented
- [ ] Data retention policy defined

## Deployment Security Measures

### 🔒 Access Control
1. **Restrict Access**: Deploy on internal network or access-controlled server
2. **IP Whitelisting**: Consider restricting access to authorized IP ranges
3. **Authentication**: Consider adding basic HTTP authentication
4. **Directory Protection**: Use `.htaccess` or server-level restrictions

### 🔒 Data Protection
1. **HTTPS Only**: Always deploy with SSL/TLS encryption
2. **Secure Headers**: Implement security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
3. **Log Security**: Secure log files from unauthorized access
4. **Data Minimization**: Only collect necessary information

### 🔒 Network Security
1. **Firewall Rules**: Properly configure firewall for minimal exposure
2. **Network Segmentation**: Deploy in isolated network segment if possible
3. **Monitoring**: Network traffic monitoring in place
4. **Intrusion Detection**: Consider IDS/IPS systems

## Runtime Security Monitoring

### 📊 What to Monitor
- [ ] Number of attempts per IP address
- [ ] Geographic distribution of attempts
- [ ] Success vs. failure rates
- [ ] Unusual patterns or automated behavior
- [ ] System resource usage
- [ ] Error rates and system health

### 🚨 Alert Thresholds
Set up alerts for:
- [ ] High volume of attempts from single IP
- [ ] Successful authentications
- [ ] System errors or failures
- [ ] Unusual geographic patterns
- [ ] Attempts outside business hours

## Post-Deployment Actions

### 📋 Regular Maintenance
- [ ] Review logs weekly
- [ ] Update security patches promptly
- [ ] Rotate SMTP credentials quarterly
- [ ] Test notification system monthly
- [ ] Review and update documentation

### 📊 Reporting
- [ ] Weekly summary reports
- [ ] Incident documentation
- [ ] Effectiveness metrics
- [ ] Recommendations for security improvements

## Incident Response

### 🚨 If Compromised
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Take system offline immediately
   - Preserve logs for forensic analysis
   - Notify stakeholders
   - Change all passwords

2. **Investigation**:
   - Analyze access logs
   - Determine scope of breach
   - Identify root cause
   - Document timeline

3. **Recovery**:
   - Apply security patches
   - Implement additional controls
   - Restore from clean backup
   - Monitor for continued compromise

### 📞 Emergency Contacts
Document contact information for:
- [ ] IT Security Team
- [ ] Legal Department
- [ ] Management
- [ ] Law Enforcement (if required)

## Cleanup and Decommissioning

### 🧹 When Testing is Complete
- [ ] Remove all system files from web server
- [ ] Securely delete log files or archive for retention
- [ ] Revoke access credentials
- [ ] Document lessons learned
- [ ] Update security awareness materials

### 📚 Documentation
- [ ] Final report with findings
- [ ] Security recommendations
- [ ] System performance metrics
- [ ] User feedback and observations

## Risk Assessment

### ⚠️ High Risk Scenarios
- **Credential Leakage**: System compromise could expose valid credentials
- **Legal Issues**: Unauthorized use could result in legal action
- **Reputation Damage**: Misuse could damage organization reputation
- **Technical Issues**: System failures could disrupt legitimate email services

### 🛡️ Mitigation Strategies
- Implement strong access controls
- Regular security audits
- Comprehensive monitoring
- Clear usage policies
- Regular training for operators

## Compliance Considerations

### 📋 Regulatory Compliance
Consider requirements for:
- [ ] GDPR (if applicable)
- [ ] HIPAA (for healthcare)
- [ ] SOX (for financial services)
- [ ] Industry-specific regulations
- [ ] Local privacy laws

### 📝 Documentation Requirements
- [ ] Data processing agreements
- [ ] Privacy impact assessments
- [ ] Audit trails
- [ ] Consent mechanisms (if required)
- [ ] Data retention schedules
